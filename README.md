# DriveTools
These are some tools to automatically sync folders with Google Drive.
My use-case is auto-uploading logs from machine learning experiments ran at a server.

This code will sync a local folder with a folder on Google Drive, skipping all files whose local modification time is older than the remote.

This is just one-off code, so don't expect a better readme.
